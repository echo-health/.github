#### What does this PR do?
A short description of PR goes here. Relate back to ticket ACs or defect solved.
#### What are the relevant tickets?
* FN-0000: main ticket (see description above)
* FN-0001: small fix on **example.js**, lines `4` and `8`.
* FN-0002: added `.example-class` on **example.scss**
#### Where should the reviewer start?
1. ExampleUtil.js: added this very important new util this is used in Example.jsx
2. Example.jsx
3. Example.scss
4. Root.js, index.js, and index.scss
#### How should this be manually tested?
1. Log in and navigate to **/example**
2. Click on **X** and see if you get the **Y** message
3. Make sure **Z** looks like on the design
#### Are there any breaking changes?
#### Any background context you want to provide?
I did the same thing here that Matt did on his current open PR.
